# Stateful Menu

This is a simple example of how you can store state in a react component to encapsulate UI concerns outside of the main Elmish model.

It is just the out-of-the box SAFE Todo app with a push menu added.

This example just uses basic component state - for more advanced scenarios consider the `React.useElmish' hook [provided by Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/Hooks/UseElmish) to give the component its own separate MVU loop.
